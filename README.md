## Alec's Password Generator

# Description
The password generator was created to test my JavaScript skills. This password generator allows the user to pick how the types of charcacters they want and how long they would like their password to be. At a click of a button (and after some questions answered) you are given a new password to use made up of random characters.

# Usage
Click the generate password button. Answer the questions given to you and then your new password will appear!
